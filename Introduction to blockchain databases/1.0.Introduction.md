# 1. Introduction

As blockchain technology becomes embedded in the finance and financial services industries, cryptocurrencies gain prevalence, and the potential for additional blockchain applications continues to grow, industry participants are likely to face heightened regulatory scrutiny, even as the regulatory landscape shifts and evolves with the technology.
