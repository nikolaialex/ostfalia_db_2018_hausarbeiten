## 3.1. Structure 
Blockchains employ a single chain of blocks to provide a validated, secure, and distributed consensus. Data on a blockchain is grouped together and organized in blocks. As Figure "Blockchain Structure" shows, the blocks are then linked to one another and secured using cryptography.

*Figure 1: Blockchain Structure*

A blockchain is essentially a continuously growing list of records. Its’ append-only structure only allows addition of data to the database: altering or deleting previously entered data on earlier blocks is impossible. Blockchain technology is therefore well-suited for recording events, managing records, processing transactions, tracing assets, and voting.

Blocks are container data structures that help in bringing together of transactions to be included in the public ledgers. Their structure includes a header and a long list of transactions. The header stores metadata, which includes the data about the different data stored in the header.

*Figure 2: Structure of block head*

Figure 2 shows the structure of head block. The header of each block consists of the following fields:<br/>
- Index – which indicates the position of the block inside the block chain. The first block is indexed ‘0’, the next ‘1’, and so on.
- Hash – hash function enables the speedy identification of data in the dataset
- Previous hash – every block in blockchain data structure, is linked with its predecessors. This feature contributes to its immutability as a change in the arrangement of blocks warrants a change in the whole blockchain leading to a whole lot of computation, which is not a feasible option.
- numTx – this stores a count of the number of transactions added in the block.
- Timestamp – stores the time details of when the block was created.
- Nonce – stores the integer (32 or 64bits) that are used in the mining process
- Transaction –  This is another field stored as arrays in the body of the block. They store the complete summary of transaction performed so far in the block. Here, data storage is done with the help of another data structure called Merkle trees.
