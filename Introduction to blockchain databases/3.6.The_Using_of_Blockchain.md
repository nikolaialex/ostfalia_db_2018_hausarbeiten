## 3.6.The Using of Blockchains database
In this subchapter, two majors using of Blockchain database will be introduced and compared. They are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin was first released on January 3rd, 2009[9] while Ethereum’s live blockchain was initially launched on July 30th, 2015[10]. Both of these cryptocurrencies are exchanging based on blockchain technology. Both of them are using blockchain technology, but they have different goals in mind, which can be seen through the coding protocols put in place. <br/><br/>
**Bitcoin**<br/>
Bitcoin is currently the most used and known cryptocurrency. In the past year, its value has risen very quickly. It has risen to a point that it is in 2017 worth more than $15.000 (see Figure “Bitcoin - Dollar (BTC - USD) Chart - 5 years”) and quite frequently Bitcoin is mentioned in the news. <br/><br/>
Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography to make and verify digital signatures for its transactions. The point of this is that only a user with the private key can sign a transaction to send some bitcoins to somebody else, but anybody in the network can validate a transaction by using the public key. User can create an online wallet or a wallet on some hardware which contains the private keys.<br/><br/>

<br/>**Ethereum**<br/>
Ethereum is another uprising cryptocurrency that works with a blockchain. But Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency, since the blockchain can be used in multiple ways and Ethereum is using that property. Instead of an online currency only, people can also use smart contracts and different applications like games, (domain-)name registration or a decentralized file storage. This is possible because the developers of Ethereum provided a built-in Turing-complete programming language for the blockchain. The programming language can be used to create "smart contracts" which are used to create different applications. All of this is decentralized, because of the technique from the blockchain [12].<br/><br/>
Ethereum is more browser-like to access in comparison with Bitcoin. There are a few different browser platforms from which you can access and even some plugins [13].<br/><br/>
Ether is the main currency of Ethereum and can be used to pay for computation or transaction fees. On the 2014 presale of Ethereum, the total supply of ether and the rate of issuance was decided by the donations that were gathered [14]. The results were:
- 60 million ether. This amount of ether was created for the contributors of the presale.
- 12 million (20% of the 60 million) were created for the development fund. Most of this ether went to early contributors and the developers of Ethereum. The remaining of this 20% ether went to the Ethereum Foundation.
- 5 ether as the mining reward for the miner. This is now reduced to 3 ether for a block.
- The uncle/aunt reward. This reward is for other miners. If these other miners find a solution, but their block is not included in the chain, they will receive this reward.

The total amount of ether is not infinite. The issuance of ether is restricted at 18 million ether per year. This means the absolute issuance is fixed, but the relative inflation is decreased every year. At some point, the rate of new ether created will reach the average amount of ether that is lost every year, for example by misuse, death of holders or key loss. This loss and issuance will be in balance.<br/><br/>
**Comparison**<br/>
In this subchapter these two cryptocurrencies will be compared. To make everything clear, the most important aspects that will be compared are put in following table for a quick overview.<br/>

Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to grow this big and is the best known around the world. Ethereum is growing fast and becoming more known to the world and might surpass Bitcoin in size since it is faster and uses less energy now and will even use less energy in the future. The ability to use Ethereum for more than just an online currency also makes it more versatile and useful for people.<br/><br/>
