# 4.Summary
Blockchain, like the Internet, is an open, global infrastructure that allows companies and individuals making transactions to cut out the middleman, reducing the cost of transactions and the time lapse of working through third parties. The technology is based on a distributed ledger structure and consensus process. The structure allows a digital ledger of transactions to be created and shared between distributed computers on a network. The ledger is not owned or controlled by one central authority or company and can be viewed by all users on the network.

Whatever we ought to always analyze the user cases and choose the proper database. Generally, a blockchain is ideal for Monetary transactions, Transfer of value, Verification of trusted data (identity, reputation, credibility, integrity, etc.), Public Key Verification, Decentralized applications (DApps), Voting systems and so on.

There is no doubt that we can get many benefits of blockchains. At the same time, there are still some challenges with blockchain, which we need to overcome.
